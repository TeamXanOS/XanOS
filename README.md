**Have you just look inside the [Atlas repo](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/)..?**
It is full of placebo, bad tweaks.

And when you installed Atlas, it's even worst because it didn't remove all of the files that it was suppose to remove, that's how I created **XanOS**, pretty much AtlasOS 2.0.

## How to install?
Today is the age where we stop use **.iso** files to install a modified windows version/build

We use [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io/) to install XanOS on **your** computer

*NOTE: you will need to wipe/factory reset windows to avoid errors in AME Wizard*

All you have to do is just follow the steps showed in AME Wizard and you're done.

## So what's the difference between Xan vs Atlas?

* Removes software that no one cares about, like `hh.exe`
* Replace tweaks with much advance ones, like [Defender Remover](https://github.com/jbara2002/windows-defender-remover)
* Remove "Atlas" from being everywhere on your computer
* Remove placebo tweaks
* Many more.

## **Chocolatey**
XanOS comes with a package manager, [**Chocolatey**](https://community.chocolatey.org/)

You can install any program from the [repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages), fast and easy!

# FAQ

Ameliorated is saying that XanOS is unverified, suspicious...

![Unverified Playbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamXanOS/Discussions/main/pictures/unverified.jpg)

Reason being to get it verified, @XanderFromFortnite will have to pay $10 each month, and @XanderFromFortnite is lazy 2 pay for that, so it's unverified.
